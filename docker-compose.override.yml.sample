# The "Multiple Compose File" feature provides a very powerful way to override
# any configuration in docker-compose.yml without needing to modify
# git-checked-in files since that results in conflicts when upgrading this repo.
# See https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#multiple-compose-files for more.

# Just copy this file to `docker-compose.override.yml` and customise it to your liking.
# `cp docker-compose.override.yml.sample docker-compose.override.yml`

# Some example overrides are commented out below. Any uncommented section
# below will automatically override the same section in
# docker-compose.yml when ran with `docker-compose up`.
# See https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#adding-and-overriding-configuration for details.

# WARNING: This is for power users only and requires a deep understanding of Docker Compose
# and how the local docker-compose.yml is configured.
